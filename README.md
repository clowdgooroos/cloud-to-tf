# Cloud to TF

Developers will build cloud resources without first learning terraform. This causes friction when repeating, streamlining, and integrating cloud components. Cloud to TF is to the rescue! Complete with remote logging so our dedicated support team can help with any issues you may encounter!

Shift left cloud resource generation via terraform automation and leverage and transform cloud automation into terraform ready modules.

## Usage

Usage is rather simple! 

```bash
usage: main.py [-h] -r REGION -o OUTPUT

A tool for reversing AWS resources into Terraform code

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Region to pull data from
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file for TF code
```

## Roadmap

The tool has a lot of potential. 

Sarah, can you please update this portion for me?
